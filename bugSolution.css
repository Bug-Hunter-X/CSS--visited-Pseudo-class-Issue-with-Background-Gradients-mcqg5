To solve this uncommon issue, we can use the `!important` flag to give the `:visited` style higher precedence:

```css
a {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, blue, green);
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  text-decoration: none;
}
a:visited {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, red, yellow) !important;
  color: black !important;
}
```

Using `!important` forces the browser to apply the `:visited` style, overriding any potential conflicts with the initial style. Note that overusing `!important` is generally discouraged, but in this specific scenario, it provides a reliable solution to an uncommon CSS quirk.
